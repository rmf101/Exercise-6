How it works: The program (SimpleProgram.ipy) prompts the user for an input and feeds it into two string variables, name and age. It then prints them out.

Installation: 
1. In JupyterLab, open a Launcher and select `Terminal`
2. Type in `cd [directory]` to open the directory where the program will be copied.
    
3. Copy and paste the following command into the terminal using Ctrl+Shift+V:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/adyaksich/Exercise-6.git
    ```
4. You should see a new folder named `Exercise-6` inside the directory you chose with the program inside.
